        <h2>Research</h2>
            <hr>

        <p>In my research I use tools from Applied Econometrics with a particular emphasis on spatial data. 
		I am mainly interested in questions in Economic Geography, Political Economics, and Long-Run Economic Development. <p>

                We investigate the impact of commercial television on political participation and local policy outcomes. Exploiting a geographically staggered expansion of cable television after the liberalization of Norwegian broadcasting in 1981, we show that higher cable television penetration significantly reduced turnout in municipal elections. Using individual-level data, we find that cable television coverage had a negative effect on the extent to which respondents were exposed to political information through mass media. The effect is more pronounced for individuals that on average watch more cable television; namely individuals with fewer years of schooling. Consistent with an increased difference in political participation and exposure to information between more and less educated groups, we find that commercial television led to reduced public spending and increased the share spent on education. The results are evidence that commercial mass media can influence electoral politics by reducing political participation and exposure to information of its target audiences.

                This paper analyzes the role of international trade networks in city formation using a staggered removal of restrictions on trade with Europe within the Spanish Empire. Using detailed georeferenced data on geography, infrastructure, and maritime travel from historical logbooks, I show the reforms induced substantial reductions in average trade costs. Using a difference-in-difference methodology, I show the reforms promoted city formation, especially in the peripheral areas with higher connectivity. Moreover, the reform accelerated the formation of cities close to natural navigable waterways, such as coasts. To assess long-run effects, I use the calculated changes in trade-costs to estimate the parameters of a dynamic spatial general equilibrium model. The model shows that the delayed opening of long-distance trade reduced the long-run coastal population density, but that the effect is muted in areas less populated at the time of the reform. Finally, I find that the induced variation in coastal population density has persisted until the present, which has implications for welfare in regions with high internal transportation costs.

               <li>Does High-speed Internet Erode Democracy? Evidence on Turnout and Polarization from a Norwegian
Broadband Reform,  
                 <br>with <a href="https://www.skorge.info/" target="https://www.skorge.info/">Øyvind Skorge</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/oeysteinmhernaes/" target="https://sites.google.com/site/oeysteinmhernaes/">Øystein Hernæs</a>.
                <br><button class="accordion"></button> <div class="panel" id="section01">
                To what extent the surge of high-speed internet has contributed to democratic erosion is contested. One the one hand, it may crowd out voters’ consumption of traditional media with higher and more unbiased knowledge about politics, which is expected to lessen turnout and polarize those who nonetheless vote. On the other hand, it may add to individuals’ existing news consumption and increase political knowledge, which is expected to increase turnout and leave polarization unaffected. To evaluate these competing hypotheses, we exploit a large-scale broadband reform that was rolled out in a staggered fashion across Norwegian municipalities during the 2000-2008 period. Our instrumental variable analysis reveals a positive effect of high-speed internet usage on the turnout rate in municipal elections and a small (and insignificant) negative effect on polarization in vote choice. We also show that the arrival of high-speed internet increased time online without replacing the consumption of newspapers, radio, and TV. Our analysis suggests that high-speed internet have more nuanced effects on electoral participation than what is commonly asserted.
